# MTECH Code Challenge

Live Demo can be viewed [here](https://izacpeterson.github.io/MTECH_challenge/).

To run locally, clone the repo or download/extract the ZIP. Open the index.html in your favorite browser.

## Requirements:

- Must use pure html, css, and javascript(jQuery is the only library/framework allowed).
- Users can create their own display name with their comment.
- Add the posts from newest to oldest(Newest post at the top).
- When a user clicks the delete button on a comment, remove that comment from the page.
- When a user clicks the edit button, allow the comment to be edited and change the original comment when submitted.
- The original post MUST be fixed on top of the page. Meaning when the user scrolls through the comments the original post("Trying to decide a career path? Programming is the move. Change my mind.") will stay on top of the comments and will always be shown.
- The same goes for the "creating a comment" section. Make sure it is fixed on the bottom of the page and stays on top of the comments as the user scrolls.
